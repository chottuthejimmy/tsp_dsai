## About Me

I am currently a student, studying AI and ML, currently in my junior year of undergrad. I am passionate about AI and Data Science and I am looking forward to learning more about it through this [course](https://github.com/The-Scrappy-Project/tsp_dsai). I am also interested in learning about the applications of AI in the field of healthcare and how it can be used to improve the quality of life and ulitmately benefit the humanity! :)
