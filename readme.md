## About Me

I am currently a student, studying AI and ML, currently in my junior year of undergrad. I am passionate about AI and Data Science and I am looking forward to learning more about it through this course. I am also interested in learning about the applications of AI in the field of healthcare and how it can be used to improve the quality of life for people.
