This document outlines a few datasets that I found interesting on Kaggle.

## 1. Students Performance in Exams

### Dataset Overview
This [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams) includes demographic information and test scores for students in math, reading, and writing. It allows for an in-depth look into how different factors such as meal type, test preparation, and parental education level affect students' performance.

Analysis that can be done on this dataset: Investigate how demographic factors such as parental education level and meal type influence student performance.




## 2. UCI Heart Disease

### Dataset Overview
The [UCI Heart Disease Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/redwankarimsony/heart-disease-data) contains data on various attributes that may be associated with heart disease. It's a great dataset for anyone interested in cardiovascular health and predictive modeling.


## 3. Kepler Exoplanet Search Results

### Dataset Overview
The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/nasa/kepler-exoplanet-search-results) from the Kepler space telescope contains information on exoplanet search results, including data on confirmed exoplanets and candidates. It's a rich dataset for anyone interested in astronomy and exoplanet research.

### Proposed Analysis
- **Exoplanet Classification**: Classify exoplanets based on their properties and determine potential habitability.
- **Trend Analysis**: Analyze trends in exoplanet discoveries over time and by different detection methods.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Use machine learning to predict the likelihood of unconfirmed candidates being true exoplanets.
